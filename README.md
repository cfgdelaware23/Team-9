# Team-9

WellFair:
Q: Do we have to come up with the personalized pricing model?
A: No, we create the infrastructure of the membership system (signing up households, client-side, cashier-side, admin-side)
Q: Is the membership model similar to whole foods? (do they need email, other creds)
A: The idea is to create a solution that DOES NOT REQUIRE a smartphone (in-person registration?) no sign-in,
that's gonna make some blockers for families. NEeds: Does work w smartphone/web, No interaction in the store

We want to create infrastructure (database management, client-side/cashier/admin-side profiles, database storing 
customer info, point of sale information (ask customers questions ON SALE), )

We want to develop an idea that does not require a smartphone. It's up to our discretion how much we want to focus on
smartphone/non-smartphone companies
Still can have a qualification process (on SNAP, welfare, etc.)

Element of trust between customer and store (need to ensure that the customer is eligible for membership)
at some point, do products become free?
No drivers lisence, or IDs, but trust system. 
Qualifiers:
Do you have an EBT card?
Address
airtable
two sig airtable app (datagather)

Government collaboration
spread by word of mouth
(hellofresh)

Integration of other companies:
Doordash/instacart

Customer feedback:
At checkout
Practical HCI 

shareholders:
customers with a smartphone
customers without a smartphone
produce providers (provide products with 2-3 months of shelf life)

Ideas:
verified buyer tier? vs non-verified buyer;
EBT Card, 
streamline qualification system
speak to what is popular in the neighborhood
offer betterbox subscription in store (popups will stop operating, physical store will act as a popup)

To avoid:
no shelf interaction
anything with a card
unhealthy, popular brands

Biggest Obstacles:
Developing something that doesn't require a smartphone, because everything becomes a little simpler
