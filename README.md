WellFair:
Q: Do we have to come up with the personalized pricing model?
A: No, we create the infrastructure of the membership system (signing up households, client-side, cashier-side, admin-side)
Q: Is the membership model similar to whole foods? (do they need email, other creds)
A: The idea is to create a solution that DOES NOT REQUIRE a smartphone (in-person registration?) no sign-in,
that's gonna make some blockers for families. NEeds: Does work w smartphone/web, No interaction in the store

We want to create infrastructure (database management, client-side/cashier/admin-side profiles, database storing 
customer info, point of sale information (ask customers questions ON SALE), )

We want to develop an idea that does not require a smartphone. It's up to our discretion how much we want to focus on
smartphone/non-smartphone companies
Still can have a qualification process (on SNAP, welfare, etc.)

Element of trust between customer and store (need to ensure that the customer is eligible for membership)
at some point, do products become free?
No drivers lisence, or IDs, but trust system. 
Qualifiers:
Do you have an EBT card?
Address
airtable
two sig airtable app (datagather)

Government collaboration
spread by word of mouth
(hellofresh)

Integration of other companies:
Doordash/instacart

Customer feedback:
At checkout
Practical HCI 

shareholders:
customers with a smartphone
customers without a smartphone
produce providers (provide products with 2-3 months of shelf life)

Ideas:
verified buyer tier? vs non-verified buyer;
EBT Card, 
streamline qualification system
speak to what is popular in the neighborhood
offer betterbox subscription in store (popups will stop operating, physical store will act as a popup)

To avoid:
no shelf interaction
anything with a card
unhealthy, popular brands

Biggest Obstacles:
Developing something that doesn't require a smartphone, because everything becomes a little simpler





More Wellfare Q/A Notes:


-using a membership card

-want to emphasize feedback.

-avoid and lower shelf interaction and anything to do with a card

-dont utilize a smart phone 

-think of customers that dont have access to smart phone(can;t just assume)

-not clunky, very clean is the ideal. for both the user and cashier.

-create an equitable experience and emphasis on accessibility

-try and tackle any single part of the full customer experience rather than tackle everything at once

-optimize and innovate one of those sections.

-traditional retail purchasing for the newly released market

-how customer sign up currently

-can sign up online, on the phone, or at certain distrubtion points

-as little barriers of entry as possible, 

-email should not be requires, keep eligibility light

-when should questions be asked? through what medium? 

should we asked when they order a certain amount? Does the cashier ask the questions themselves? 

Online surverys etc are heavily ignored I feel

-want the market to have consistency in terms of 50% produce etc , 50% packaged food (pasta, cereal, supplements, etc).

-want it to speak to what people eat in those neighborhoods. Not overly fancy (tiktok/fancy style) foods or snacks. Want it to resonate with the target customer.

can maybe address this? maybe incoportate this in the feedback section? 

- quanititative questions, how many did you buy? how much did you eat?
- How did you like it? what is priced too high? or fairly?
- Beverage is essential to adress, so maybe ask questions tailored to that
    - strongly sugarized and a huge cause for diabates in US

-want a lot of control with all back end aspects of the store.

-Huge spectrum of this who are eligible

-how can we incentivise more sign ups and how can we make the in-person experience positive enough to not only create great feedback.

-how to authenticate the sign-in process and really ensure that there is not an abuse of people signing up who dont need the benifits

-can address this issue!
